## Scope

Scoping is a concept in programming langauge that refers where to look for things (identifiers) at execution time. Mainly there are two types of scoping:

- Lexical scoping (static scoping)
- Dynamic scoping

JavaScript use **Lexical scoping** to resolve the identifiers in program. JavaScript's scope is determined at complied time and its fixed and predictable.

游녤 JavaScript creates scope for **functions** and **blocks** (only in case of let and const). Scopes can be nested as well.

```js
游댮 var teacher = "kyle";

游댮 function otherClass() {
    游댯 var teacher = "Suzy";

    游댯 function ask(question) {
        console.log(游댯 teacher, 游릭 question);
        {
            // Block scope (only in case let and const)
            游리 let question = "What is block scope?";
            console.log(游리 question);
        }
    }

    ask("Why?");
}

otherClass();
ask();
```

```js
// These are are the coloured bucket (functions & blocks)
游댮 Global scope
    游댯 Function scope `otherClass`
        游릭 Function scope `ask`
            游리 block scope
```

**Lexical scope means that a function can reference a variable outside of its scope and it just goes up the scope chain to find it.**

## Dynamic global variables

**Dynamic global variables are created at run-time** not at compiled time.

```js
游댮 var teacher = "Kyle";

游댮 function otherClass() {
    游댮 teacher = "Suzy";
    topic = "React"; // dynamic global variable crated at global scope: RED
    console.log("Welcome!");
}

游댮 otherClass();

teacher; // Suzy
topic; // React
```

## Strict mode

Strict mode throws an error which were silent in sloppy mode.

- Dynamic global variable throws an error in strict mode.
- Writing read-only properties are not allowed.
- Cannot delete variable using delete operator.

```js
var teacher = "Kyle";

function otherClass() {
  teacher = "Suzy";
  topic = "React"; // ReferenceError
  console.log("Welcome!");
}

otherClass();
```

## Undefined vs undeclared

**Undefined** means a variable exists but at the moment it has no value. **Undeclared** means a variable doesn't exists in any of the scope that we have access to.

## Key points to remember

- Scope refers where to look for identifiers during execution. Lexical scoped language has a fixed and predictable scope.
- JavaScript creates a scope plan during first phase and this plan used during execution phase.
- non strict mode allows global dynamic variables.
