# Scope

JavaScript is not a interpreted language rather we should think about JavaScript is a two pass processing. In first pass JavaScript creates a plan for scope all the identifiers are arranged in scope during this phase and JavaScript use this plan during second phase (execution).

Scoping is a concept in programming langauge that refers where to look for things (identifiers) at execution time. Mainly there are two types of scoping:

- Lexical scoping (static scoping)
- Dynamic scoping

JavaScript uses **Lexical scoping** to resolve the identifiers in program. The scope is determined when the code is compiled.

ðŸ‘‰ JavaScript manages scope for `functions` and `block`

## Compilation & Scope phase

```js
ðŸ”´ var teacher = "kyle";

ðŸ”´ function otherClass() {
    ðŸ”µ var teacher = "Suzy";
    console.log("Welcome");
}

ðŸ”´ function ask() {
    ðŸŸ¢ var question = "Why?";
    console.log(question);
}

otherClass(); // Welcome!
ask(); // Why?
```

```js
here `otherClass` and `ask` scope is nested inside the Global scope
ðŸ”´ Global scope
    ðŸ”µ Local scope `otherClass`
    ðŸŸ¢ Local scope `ask`
```

# Dynamic global variables

Below code have a `topic` which is not a formal declaration so `topic` identifier will not be a part of scoping phase it will generated at run-time which is called **dynmaic global variable**.

```js
ðŸ”´ var teacher = "Kyle";

ðŸ”´ function otherClass() {
    ðŸ”´ teacher = "Suzy";
    topic = "React";
    console.log("Welcome!");
}

ðŸ”´ otherClass();

teacher; // Suzy
topic; // React
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Dynamic global variables are not allowed in strict mode**. in strict mode `topic` will be a ReferenceError.
