# Scope

Scoping is a concept in programming langauge that refers where to look for things (identifiers) at execution time. Mainly there are two types of scoping:

- Lexical scoping (static scoping)
- Dynamic scoping

JavaScript uses **Lexical scoping** to resolve the identifiers in program. The scope is determined when the code is compiled.
