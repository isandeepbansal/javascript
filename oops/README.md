## Object oriented programming

A programming **paradigm** centered around **objects** rather than functions.

## Four pillars of object oriented programming

- Encapsulation (group related variables and functions together)
- Abstraction (hide compexity)
- Inheritance (eliminate redundant code)
- Polymorphism (many form)
