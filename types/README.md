# Types in JavaScript

JavaScript types can be divided into two categories **primitive** and **non-primitive** or **objects**.

## Primitive types

- `undefined`
- `string`
- `number`
- `boolean`
- `null`
- `symbol`
- `bigint`

## Non Primitive

- `object`

ðŸ‘‰ **In JavaScript, variables don't have types values do.**

# `typeof` operator

`typeof` operator is used to determine the type of a value, **`typeof` operator always returns string**. `typeof` operator is the only operator in JavaScript that can reference a variable which doesn't exist without throwing an error.

```js
var v;
typeof v; // "undefined"

v = "1";
typeof v; // "string"

v = 2;
typeof v; // "number"

v = true;
typeof v; // "boolean"

v = {};
typeof v; // "object"

v = Symbol();
typeof v; // "symbol"

v = 42n;
typeof v; // "bigint"
```

## Edge cases with `typeof` operator

```js
typeof doesNotExist; // "undefined"

v = null;
typeof v; // "object"

v = function fn() {};
typeof v; // "function"

v = [1, 2, 3];
typeof v; // "object"
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Array.isArray() method determines whether the passed value is an array**.

# Emptiness in JavaScript

- **Undefined**: means there's definitely a variable and at the moment it has no value.

- **Undeclared**: means it's never been created in any scope that we have access to. `typeof` operator is the only operator that can reference a thing that doesn't exist without throwing an error.

- **Uninitialized** This is introduced with ES6 it is also known as TDZ (temporal dead zone). The idea is that certain variables like block scope ones don't get initialized, they never initially get set to undefined when something is uninitialized state, it is off-limits.

# Special values: `NaN` and Negative zero

Within primitive types JavaScript has some special values like **NaN** and **Negative zero**.

## NaN

**NaN** naming convention is little confusing its stands for **not-a-number** but actually its a number.

```js
typeof NaN; // "number"
```

so, the correct way to think about NaN is that its a invalid number. NaN can occur in program due to some wrong mathematical operation. Example:

```js
var result = "hello" - 10;
var wrongCoerce = Number("hello");
var v = 0 * Infinity;
```

ðŸ‘‰ **NaN are not equal to each other**.

```js
NaN === NaN; // false
```

## How to check for NaN

JavaScript has two built in method to check for NaN

### 1. `isNaN`

The problem with `isNaN` method is that it always coerce the value to the number before it check for NaN. So when we pass something string like "hello world" which is definitely not a NaN it return true.

```js
isNaN(NaN); //  true
isNaN("hello world"); // true
```

### 2. `Number.isNaN`

`Number.isNaN` do not coerce the value to number so it is better choice to check something is NaN or not.

```js
Number.isNaN(NaN); // true
Number.isNaN("hello world"); // true
```
