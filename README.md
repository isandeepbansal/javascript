## How to add JavaScript in HTML

There are two ways to add JavaScript in HTML file. You can add JavaScript using `script` tag inside `head` or `body`. But it is not recommended to place `script` inside `head` with few exceptions.

Placing `script` in the end of `body` section gives you few advantages.

- It doesn't block the HTML parsing.
- HTML elements are available to script because it already parsed.

## `<script>` vs `<script async>` vs `<script defer>`

**`<script>`** HTML file will be parsed until the `script` file is hit, at that point parsing will stop and a request will be made to fetch the file (if it's external). The script will then be executed before parsing is started.

**`<script async>`** async downloads the file during HTML parsing and will pause the HTML parser to execute it when it has finished downloading.

**`<script defer>`** defer downloads the file during HTML parsing and will only execute it after the parser has completed. **defer scripts are also guarenteed to execute in the order that they appear in the document**.
